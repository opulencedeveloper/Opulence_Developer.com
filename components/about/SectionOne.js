        <p className="text-4xl font-medium">My Name is Anyanwu Macdonald Chibuike. I am a product designer based in Nigeria.</p>
    <p>I started off my career in product design since 2020 and I must say, it has been a wonderful ride. Before then, I was a graphics designer(2015-2020). I felt my graphics design experience made product design look easy and exciting to me.</p>
    <p>I come from a small town in Imo State, Nigeria and studied Computer Engineering at Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike. Abia State, Nigeria.</p>
    <p>When not online, I enjoy watching football, storytelling and hanging out with friends. I really enjoy listening to music especially Rap and RnB.</p>
    <p>I also create contents related to tech and design on <span className="underline font-semibold">Facebook</span> and <span className="underline font-semibold">YouTube</span>.</p>
