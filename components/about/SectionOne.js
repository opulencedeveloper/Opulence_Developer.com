    <p>I started off my career in product design since 2020 and I must say, it has been a wonderful ride. Before then, I was a graphics designer(2015-2020). I felt my graphics design experience made product design look easy and exciting to me.</p>
    <p>I come from a small town in Imo State, Nigeria and studied Computer Engineering at Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike. Abia State, Nigeria.</p>
    <p>When not online, I enjoy watching football, storytelling and hanging out with friends. I really enjoy listening to music especially Rap and RnB.</p>

          Welcome! I'm thrilled to have you here and share my journey in the world of programming with you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
          It all started when I was just 10 years old and I got my hands on a computer for the first time. I was fascinated by what it could do and the endless possibilities it offered. This sparked my interest in programming and led me to study it in school. But my passion didn't stop there.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
          In my quest to become a better programmer, I attended online programming classes and workshops, dedicating my time and energy to learning the latest programming languages and acquiring new skills. I honed my skills in embedded systems (Arduino), web development (HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS)), React.js, mobile application development (Flutter), Node.js (Express.js), and much more.</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
          During the 2020 lockdown, I developed a website where I posted lecture notes, assignments, and solutions for my fellow students to access with ease, covering some universities as well. This project gave me the opportunity to showcase my skills and provide value to others.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
          As my skills developed, I realized that I was hungry for more knowledge and challenges. So, I continued to learn and grow my expertise in programming. Over the past 5 years, I have been coding for fun in private, and recently turned my hobby into a career. I am determined to dedicate my life to programming and to keep expanding my knowledge with every opportunity I get.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
          I am eager for new challenges that will make me wonder, think, adapt, improve and learn new things. I believe that every project is an opportunity to learn something new and to showcase my skills. I am confident in my ability to work with you or for you and I look forward to exploring new opportunities together.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
          Thank you for taking the time to read about me and my journey in programming. Feel free to explore my portfolio and see some of the projects that I have worked on. If you have any questions or would like to discuss a project, please don't hesitate to contact me.
